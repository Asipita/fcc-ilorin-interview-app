# fcc-ilorin-interview-app
solution to the interview app problem posed at the fcc ilorin meetup
run node index.js from the root directory
only handlebars were used, so all the html-like code can be found in the views directory
js can be found in views/js
materializecss framework was used for the css

holla!
